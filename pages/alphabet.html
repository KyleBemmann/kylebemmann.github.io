     <p>The Hebrew alphabet, known variously by scholars as the Ktav Ashuri, Jewish script, square script and block script, is a unicameral abjad script used in the writing of the Hebrew language. In modern Hebrew, vowels are increasingly introduced. Hebrew script is used informally in Israel to write Levantine Arabic, especially among Druze. The script is an offshoot of the Imperial Aramaic alphabet, which flourished during the Achaemenid Empire, and which itself derives from the Phoenician alphabet.</p>

	        <h2>1 - Aleph</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">In Gematria, the traditional Hebrew numbering system, Alef has the numeric value of one (1). The number one is significant in Hebrew culture as it represents unity and beginnings, much like Alef’s positioning as the first letter. Thus, it can also point to the one true God.</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Alef, originating from the Proto-Canaanite alphabet, is thought to have depicted an ox head, signifying strength, power, and leadership. However, in the Ten Commandments, there is a small Alef in the word “אנכי” (H595, anokiy, meaning “I”) in the phrase “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2). This small Alef has been interpreted by rabbinic scholars to represent God’s humility, suggesting that the infinite God is making a covenant with finite man and is doing so with humility and affection.</p>

	        <h2>2 - Bet</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">In Gematria, the traditional Hebrew numbering system, Bet corresponds to the number two (2). This number in Hebrew culture often symbolizes both union (e.g., husband and wife) and division (e.g., good vs evil).</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Historically, Bet is represented pictographically as a house or tent, conveying the idea of a dwelling or an abode. This symbolism is seen culturally as foundational, representing the concept of family and community. One specific example of scribes giving special treatment to Bet is in Genesis 1:1, where the very first letter of the first word “בראשית” (bereishit, H7225) is written larger than the rest. This enlarged Bet is understood as drawing attention to the concept of the world being the dwelling place of all creation.</p>

	        <h2>3 - Gimmel</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">In Gematria, the traditional Hebrew numbering system, the letter Gimel corresponds to the number three (3). The number three carries significance in Hebrew tradition, often associated with concepts of completeness and stability, as seen in the three patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the three divisions of the Tanakh (Torah, Prophets, and Writings).</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Gimel is thought to derive from the ancient Phoenician alphabet, where its pictograph is believed to have resembled a camel, signifying travel or movement. In Jewish culture, it can represent kindness and generosity, as the word for camel (H1581) is associated with bearing burdens and providing transportation.</p>

	        <h2>4 - Dalet</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">In Gematria, the traditional Hebrew numbering system, Dalet represents the number four (4). Four is often seen as a symbol of completeness and universality, as in the four corners of the earth or the four seasons.</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">In ancient times, the Dalet, resembling a door in its early pictographic form, symbolized a pathway or an entryway, perhaps indicating movement and choice. Culturally, it can represent the humility one must have to learn, as a student entering the door of a teacher’s house. The letter is associated with the word “דָּל” (dal, H1800), meaning “poor” or “weak,” which can reflect a spiritual state of dependence on God, as seen in verses like Psalm 86:1, “Incline your ear, O Lord, and answer me, for I am poor and needy [H1800]).”</p>

	        <h2>5 - Hey</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">In the Hebrew numbering system (Gematria), the letter He represents the number five (5). Five has various meanings in Hebrew culture; it can symbolize grace and protection, as seen in the five fingers of the hand or the five books of the Torah, indicating a completeness in revelation.</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Historically, the letter He is thought to have depicted a man with raised arms, suggesting the act of revelation or behold. It’s a letter that also indicates breath or spirit. In Genesis, the letter He is added to Abram and Sarai’s names when God makes a covenant with them, transforming them to Abraham and Sarah, a symbolic act of conferring divine blessing and transformation (Genesis 17:5, 15).</p>

	        <h2>6 - Vav</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">In Gematria, the traditional Hebrew numbering system, Vav has the numerical value of six (6). The number six is often associated with the days of creation since God created the world in six days, leading up to the seventh day of rest (Genesis 1). It represents the completion of creation and the natural order.</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">The Hebrew letter Vav, which resembles a hook or a peg, is often understood as a connecting force. just as a hook joins two objects, the Vav connects sentences or thoughts, often being the equivalent of “and” in English. It represents unity and the binding together of distinct elements, symbolizing the connection between heaven and earth, as well as human connection.</p>

The number seven is rich in significance within Hebrew culture; it symbolizes completion and perfection, often linked to the creation week where God completed the work of creation in six days and rested on the seventh (Genesis 2:2).</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">In ancient times, Zayin was symbolically linked to a weapon, possibly looking like a sword or axe, based on its pictographic roots. This symbol can reflect themes of cutting, dividing, or nourishing (as tools also harvested food).</p>

	        <h2>8 - Chet</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">In Gematria, the traditional Hebrew numbering system, Khet represents the number eight (8). Eight often symbolizes new beginnings, reflecting the day after creation’s completion in Genesis and the day of circumcision for Hebrew males as a covenant sign.</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">The shape of Khet has been likened to a doorway or gate, suggesting a passage or entrance. Culturally, it can symbolize an opportunity or an opening to new experiences and wisdom. In the Old Testament, variations in the letter’s form can be significant; for example, an enlarged Khet can denote an emphasis on the word it begins.</p>

	        <h2>9 - Tet</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Tet has the numerical value of nine (9) in the Hebrew numbering system, Gematria. The number nine can symbolize truth in Jewish tradition, as it is the last single digit and hence seen as a symbol of truth and eternity.</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">While some Hebrew letters have a clear pictographic origin, Tet’s ancient pictographic form is less agreed upon by scholars. It may represent a basket or womb, symbolizing the containment of something. It is often seen as “containing goodness,” as it is also the first letter in the Hebrew word for “good“ (H2896).</p>

	        <h2>10 - Yod</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Yod has a numerical value of ten (10). The number ten is meaningful in Hebrew tradition; it signifies completeness and order, evident in the Ten Commandments and the ten statements with which the world was created. Thus, Yod is associated with the fullness of creation and law. Not to mention that Yod helps form many of God’s names and attributes.</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Culturally, Yod represents a hand or a pointing finger, which could signify direction, work, or possession. Its small size is noted in religious texts, symbolizing humility and the infinitesimal yet essential things in life. For example, it is taught that not one Yod of the Law is insignificant, stressing that even the smallest parts of the scriptures hold great importance (Matthew 5:18).</p>

	        <h2>20 - Kaf</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Kaf represents the number 20 in Gematria (Hebrew numbering system). Twenty is considered significant because it is twice ten, and ten carries the weight of completeness in Jewish tradition, as seen in the Ten Commandments. Therefore, twenty can be seen as a symbol of reinforced or double completeness, sometimes related to waiting periods or stages of life in Jewish culture.</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">The original form of Kaf is thought to resemble the palm of an open hand, indicating giving, receiving, or covering. This open hand can signify God’s provision as well as human action. An interesting cultural practice is the use of a larger Kaf in some Torah scrolls, for example in the Shema prayer, emphasizing the importance of the action to “write them on the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), where the “them” refers to the words of the prayer. This larger Kaf can be seen as a symbolic reminder of the role actions play in faith.</p>

	        <h2>30 - Lamed</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Lamed carries the numerical value of thirty (30) in the Hebrew numbering system, Gematria. The number thirty can symbolize dedication to a particular task or the maturity that comes with experience, as it was the age at which priests began their service (Numbers 4:2–3) and David began his reign as king (2 Samuel 5:4).</p>
	        <p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">In ancient pictograph form, Lamed is believed to resemble a shepherd’s staff, which signifies authority and the act of leading or guiding. The staff is a potent symbol in Hebrew culture, representing leadership as seen in the role of the shepherd, a common biblical metaphor for a ruler or teacher. The Lamed’s shape, with its towering ascender, also makes it the tallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet, which could be interpreted to reflect its significance in providing direction.</p>

The number forty is historically significant in Hebrew culture, often associated with periods of testing, trial, or probation, like the forty days of rain for Noah (Genesis 7:12) and the Israelites’ forty years in the desert (Numbers 14:33–34).</p>
	        <p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Mem is traditionally believed to represent water, as its shape is reminiscent of a wave. It also has a consistent presence in words related to water (H4325). Water is essential for life and is often used symbolically in scripture to represent cleansing and life itself</p>

	        <h2>50 - Nun</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">In Gematria, the traditional Hebrew numbering system, the letter Nun is represents the number fifty (50). In traditional Hebrew, this number can symbolize freedom and fullness of life, possibly linked to the concept of the Jubilee year (every 50th year), a time of liberation and restoration prescribed in Leviticus 25:10.</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">The letter Nun is thought to derive from an ancient pictogram of a snake or a fish, representing activity or life. Nun is associated with numerous Hebrew words that convey the concepts of faithfulness, continuity, and perpetuity. For instance, the word for “soul” (H5315), starts with Nun, and it is essential to many discussions of human life and spirituality in the Old Testament.</p>

	        <h2>60 - Samekh</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Samekh represents the number 60 in the Hebrew numerical system. The number sixty can be seen in various Jewish customs and legal discussions, especially in the concept of “Bittul b’Shishim,” which refers to the nullification of a forbidden substance if it is less than 1/60th of the mixture.</p>
	        <p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Historically, the Samekh is believed to have been derived from a pictograph representing a shield, implying protection or support. This symbolic meaning carries over into texts, such as in Psalm 145:14, where the word for “upholds” (H5564) contains the Samekh. It is a portrayal of strength and support, resonating with the idea of divine sustenance and shelter.</p>

	        <h2>70 - Ayin</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Ayin has a numerical value of 70 in the Hebrew numbering system (Gematria). The number 70 is traditionally considered the number of nations in the world (see Genesis 10), the number of scholars who translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek for Septuagint (LXX), and it’s associated with wisdom and insight, perhaps due to the 70 elders appointed by Moses in the Bible in Exodus 24:1.</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Historically, the letter Ayin is believed to have originated from a pictogram of an eye in ancient Semitic languages, which is fitting since “ayin” also means “eye” in Hebrew (H5869), symbolizing perception and awareness.</p>

	        <h2>80 - Pey</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Pe corresponds to the number eighty (80) in the Hebrew numbering system (Gematria). The number eighty is associated with strength and vigor, likely due to Moses being eighty years old when he confronted Pharaoh, as narrated in Exodus 7:7. It suggests a maturity that implies action and leadership.</p>
	        
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Pe is traditionally associated with the mouth (see H6310). The mouth plays a critical role in Hebrew culture: it’s the organ of speech, eating, and the breath of life. It is not only about physical sustenance but also about spiritual nourishment and communication. The letter Pe can thus be seen as a symbol of expression, the sustenance of life, creation, and the spoken word of God in the biblical texts.</p>

	        <h2>90 - Tsade</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">The numerical value of Tsadi is 90. The number ninety in Hebrew tradition could be seen as representing a certain maturity or the concept of faithfulness, possibly because it is the age at which Sarah gave birth to Isaac (see Genesis 17:17).</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Tsadi is thought to have originated from a pictograph resembling a fish hook, which held meanings of “catch” or “desire.” In the context of Hebrew culture, this could symbolize the idea of hunting or gathering, and by extension, righteousness or the act of “fishing” for justice.</p>

	        <h2>100 - Qof</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Qof holds the value of 100 in Gematria (numbering system), which in Hebrew tradition could represent a fullness or completeness in quantity, like an entire lifetime in some ancient contexts. It’s a round number, often signifying a whole unit or fullness in the biblical sense, and can sometimes be associated with the fullness of age or experience.</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">The letter Qof is believed to be derived from a pictograph of the back of a head or a needle’s eye, linking it to ideas of what follows or what is behind. It can symbolize a cycle or the horizon, where the sun sets to mark the end of a day. In ancient scribal practices, variations in the size or form of Qof could signify a need to pay attention to the end or completion of something.</p>

	        <h2>200 - Resh</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Resh has the numerical value of 200 in Hebrew gematria. The number 200 doesn’t have as prominent a place in Hebrew culture as some smaller numbers, but in some traditional contexts, it could represent an amplification of the number 20, which is associated with the expectancy of redemption and the cycle of life.</p>
	        <p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">The letter Resh is thought to symbolize a head, as it similar to the Hebrew word for “head” (H7218). This suggests leadership, a beginning point, or a person of prominence. In Hebrew manuscripts, a resh can sometimes be found in an enlarged form, possibly to emphasize the start of an important section or idea.</p>

	        <h2>300 - Shin</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">In Gematria, the traditional Hebrew numbering system, Shin/Sin represent the number 300. While 300 doesn’t carry as much inherent symbolic weight as some smaller numbers in Hebrew tradition, it is considered significant in certain contexts, such as the 300 men with Gideon (Judges 7:7) or the length of Noah’s ark in cubits (Genesis 6:15).</p>
	        	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">The original pictograph for Shin/Sin is debated, but it may have represented teeth, conveying ideas of eating, destroying, or changing. In Hebrew tradition, it is thought to be a symbol of divine power and protection. In fact, it’s often associated with “שַׁדַּי” (Shaddai, H7706), one of the names of God, which means “Almighty.” For example, the letter Shin appears on the mezuzah—a small case affixed to the doorposts of Jewish homes (see Deuteronomy 6:9)—representing “Shaddai” and serving as an emblem of God’s protection over the home.</p>

	        <h2>400 - Tav</h2>	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">Tav has the numerical value of 400 in the Hebrew numerical system (Gematria). The number 400 can symbolize a period of transformation or completion, such as the 400 years of the Israelite sojourn in Egypt (see Genesis 15:13), which ended in a dramatic change and liberation.</p>
	      	<p class="info2" style="width: 160%;">In its ancient pictographic form, Tav is believed to resemble a cross or a mark, which was used to signify a covenant, a sign, or ownership. For example, in Ezekiel 9:4, God commands a Tav mark (H8420) to be placed on the foreheads of the men who grieve and lament over all the detestable things done in Jerusalem, signifying identity and protection. In cultural context, it reflects the idea of being marked as distinct or claimed.</p>
