	        	<h2>Easter</h2>
	          	<p>While Christian Easter is based on the resurrection of Jesus, many of its associated traditions have pre-Christian, pagan origins. Over time, these spring customs were absorbed into the Christian holiday as a way to convert pagan populations</p>
	          	<p><b>Name:</b> Eostre, not Ishtar</p>
	          	<p>The English word "Easter" likely comes from the Anglo-Saxon goddess of spring, Eostre.</p>
	          	<ul>
            <li><b>Eostre/Ostara:</b> According to the 8th-century English monk Bede, Anglo-Saxons held feasts in April to honor a goddess named Eostre. Some scholars question Eostre's historical worship, but the linguistic connection to the season of dawn and new light is widely accepted.</li>
            <li><b>Ishtar connection:</b> A persistent, but erroneous, claim connects the name to the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar. This theory originated in the 19th-century anti-Catholic tract The Two Babylons and is rejected by historians.</li>
            <li><b>Pascha:</b> The name "Easter" is a uniquely English and German term. In most other languages, the holiday is called a variant of Pascha, the Greek and Latin word for Passover.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Symbols:</b> Eggs, bunnies, and hot cross buns</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><b>Eggs:</b> For millennia, eggs have been a universal symbol of new life and rebirth. Christians adopted the egg to represent Jesus's resurrection from the tomb, with the cracked shell symbolizing an empty tomb. Early Christians in Mesopotamia were dyeing eggs red for Easter before the 4th century CE.</li>
            <li><b>Bunnies:</b> Rabbits and hares have long symbolized fertility due to their reproductive abilities and are associated with spring's renewal in pagan traditions. A German folktale, recorded in the 17th century, first mentioned an "Osterhase" (Easter hare) who delivered colored eggs to good children. German immigrants later brought this tradition to the United States.</li>
            <li><b>Hot cross buns:</b> The tradition of marking buns with a cross predates Christianity, possibly symbolizing the four quarters of the moon or the four seasons in association with Eostre. Christians reinterpreted the cross on the bun to symbolize the crucifixion.</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p><b>Timing:</b> Spring equinox</p>
           <p>The practice of celebrating Easter in the spring aligns with seasonal pagan festivals that mark the vernal equinox, a time of rebirth and the return of light after winter.</p>
           <p>In 325 CE, the Council of Nicaea set the date of Easter as the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox. This ensured it would not coincide with the Jewish Passover, which had originally influenced the timing of the Christian observance.</p>

	        	<h2>Halloween</h2>
	          	<p>Samhain (pronounced "SOW-in") is an ancient Gaelic festival that marks the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter. Considered the most important of the four Celtic fire festivals, it was observed primarily in Ireland, Scotland, and the Isle of Man. The date of Samhain has deep connections to the origins of modern Halloween.</p>
	          	<h3>Key beliefs and practices</h3>
	          	 <p><b>The thinning veil:</b> The Celts believed that at Samhain, the boundary between the living world and the spirit world was at its thinnest, allowing spirits to more easily cross over. This was a time when the souls of deceased loved ones were welcomed back to their homes, but malevolent spirits and fairies (the aos sí) were also considered a threat.</p>
	          	  <p><b>Feasts and offerings:</b> Offerings of food and drink were left outside for the spirits to ensure the well-being of the family and livestock through the winter. One tradition was the "dumb supper," a silent meal where an extra place was set at the table for the dead.</p>
	          	   <p><b>Bonfires and ritual:</b> Druid priests lit great communal bonfires, and families would put out their own hearth fires beforehand. After the harvest was complete and cattle were sacrificed, families would take a flame from the sacred bonfire to relight their own hearths, which was thought to offer protection.</p>
	          	    <p><b>Costumes and guising:</b> To avoid being kidnapped by fairies or harmed by malicious spirits, people would wear costumes made of animal heads and skins. This practice evolved into "guising," where people went door-to-door in costume to receive food and drink in exchange for verses or songs.</p>
	          	<h3>Connection to Halloween</h3>
	          	<ul>
            <li>As Christianity spread through Celtic lands, the church sought to replace the pagan festival of Samhain with its own holidays.</li>
            <li>In the 9th century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as All Saints' Day (or All Hallows'), a day to honor saints and martyrs.</li>
            <li>November 2 was later designated as All Souls' Day.</li>
            <li>The evening before All Saints' Day, October 31, became known as All Hallows' Eve, and eventually, Halloween.</li>
            <li>Many of the traditions associated with Samhain persisted and were absorbed into the Christian holidays, and later into modern Halloween festivities.</li>
            <li>Trick-or-treating is thought to derive from the Samhain practice of guising and receiving food.</li>
            <li>Carving jack-o'-lanterns comes from the custom of carving turnips with grotesque faces to ward off evil spirits. Irish immigrants later adapted this tradition to use pumpkins in America.</li>
